*fs.writeFile(): 

-fs.writeFile() is used to write data to a file in Node.js. 

-If the file already exists, it overwrites the existing content. 

-If the file doesn’t exist, it creates a new one. 

-It works asynchronously and uses a callback to check for errors or success.

-fs.readFile() is used to read the content of a file. 

-It reads the file asynchronously, meaning it doesn’t block other code. 

-If the file is missing or an error occurs, it returns an error through the callback. 

-If successful, it returns the file content as a string.
